OS Tutorial by Erik Dubbelboer


This tutorial shows how to use GRUB to boot a Kernel
that is linked to a different location than it is loaded to.

The Kernel is linked to C0100000 but is loaded to 100000.
The first thing that it does is setup paging
so it can start executing at the address it is linked to.


physical memory layout:

       0 -   100000	GRUB, BIOS		1MB
  100000 -   120000	Kernel			128KB
  120000 -   124000	Boot Stack		16KB
  124000 -   125000	Boot Page-Directory	4KB
  125000 -   127000	2 Boot Page-Tables	8KB
  127000 - FFFFFFFF	Unused



virtual memory layout:
       0 -   200000	1:1 mapping of the first 2MB of memory
  200000 - C0000000	Not mapped
C0000000 - C0200000	1:1 mapping of the first 2MB of memory
C0200000 - FFFFFFFF	Not mapped
